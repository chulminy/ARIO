## Example of The ARIO (Automated Reconnaissance Image Organizer) Tool Usage
This example illustrates how to use our ARIO tool. The ARIO tool is developed to organize building reconnaissance images into a structured report. You can generate the report using your own images or the sample sets of images (see the "HOME" tab in the ARIO). The tool is being updated so we welcome your feedback and comments. We would ask you the comments regrading **(1) useful image category, (2) additional function, and (3) report layout.** To use this tool, you can follow the text guideline below or watch the instruction video [(Link)](https://youtu.be/iKPt0P9AN4o).

### **Caution**
> * This tool is designed to generate a report for an individual building. You should use a set of pictures collected from the same building when you generate each report.
> * Please do not click the back button in your web browser. 
> * The function for deleting the report is not implemented yet. Please let us know if you want to delete the report.
